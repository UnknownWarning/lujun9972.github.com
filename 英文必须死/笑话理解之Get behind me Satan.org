  The poor country pastor was livid when he confronted his wife with the receipt for a $250 dress she had bought.

  "How could you do this!" he exclaimed.

  "I don't know," she wailed, "I was standing in the store looking at the dress. Then I found myself trying it on. It was like the Devil was whispering to me, 'Gee, you look great in that dress. You should buy it.'"

  "Well," the pastor persisted, "You know how to deal with him! Just tell him, "Get behind me, Satan!"

  "I did," replied his wife, "but then he said 'It looks great from back here, too!'"

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_behind_me_Satan][Get behind me Satan]] 是耶稣对门徒[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle_Peter][peter]]说的一句话，意思是 =滚蛋吧，撒旦=

不过 =Get behind me= 也有 =到我后面来= 的意思
