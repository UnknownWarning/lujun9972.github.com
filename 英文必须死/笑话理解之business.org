#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  A shy, drunken, innocent young man walked up to a beautiful young woman in a pub and said, "Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?"

  "Yes I do," replied the beautiful young woman, "But go ahead, as I'm sure you're going to ask me anyway."

  "OK," said the shy, drunken, innocent young man, "How many men have you slept with?"

  "That's my business!" snapped the woman.

  "Oh, cool!" said the young man. "I didn't realize you made a living at it!"

=business= 可以是指 =个人的私事=,也有 =生意的意思=.

因此女孩说 =That's my business= 的意思是 =这是我的私事=,但男孩以为她是做 =皮肉生意= 的
