#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  A young Jewish man had just finished high school and wanted to go to college. He approached his father and said, "Dad, would you send me to college?"

  "Son," he replied, "You don't even know what's what! When you know what's what, I'll send you to college."

  His father then offered his son a job in the family business--a furniture store. The boy--let's call him Sam--worked in his father's store for the next year. After the year was over he approached his father again.

  "Dad," he said, "I've worked for you for a year. Now will you send me to college?"

  His dad replied, "Son, you still don't know what's what! When you know what's what I'll send you to college!"

  Sam was dejected. He left and went to a bar to have a drink. At the bar he met an attractive young lady. They seemed to hit it off well. They both left and went to her apartment. After an hour of a little of this and a little of that on the sofa, the young lady said she was going to go to her bedroom and slip into something more comfortable. When she returned she was totally naked, except for a tiny belt around her waist. Sam looked at her in astonishment. Sam pointed to the belt and asked, "What's that?"

  The lady answered, "What's what?" Sam replied, "If I knew what's what I'd be in college!!!"
