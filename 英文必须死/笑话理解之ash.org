#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Stacey makes a new friend at school and invites her home for the first time. Stacey excuses herself to fetch her mother and introduce her new friend. As her friend is standing in the living room next to the fireplace, she picks up the attractive vase on the mantle.

  When Stacey returns with her mother, her friend is staring curiously into the vase. "Oh, those are my father's ashes," Stacey informs her New friend.

  However, this startles her so that she drops the vase with a gasp! ashes and broken vase scattering all around. After turning three shades of red she stammers out, "Oh, no... I'm, oh!... I, can't... Didn't Mean to..."

  "It's OK dear," the mother says. "The vase was just from Asda."

  The new friend catches her breath enough to say, "But ... But your Husband's' ashes..."

  "Well," the mother says, "looks like he'll just have to get himself up and get the ashtray from the kitchen from now on!"

=ash= 是 =灰烬= 的意思，但是也可以特指 =骨灰=.

所以Stacey告诉她朋友是想说，花瓶里放的是 =她父亲的烟灰= ，但是她朋友理解为是 =她父亲的骨灰=
